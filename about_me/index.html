    <p>Hello! I'm Sister Gina S. Ong from the Philippines. I am pursuing Bachelors Degree in Applied Technology at BYU Idaho. I've got interest in technology because of the new trend in education. I want to improve my skill in this area to contribute more in my workplace.</p>
    <p>I am currently serving as Public Schools District Supervisor in one of the District of Malabon City. As a supervisor I am providing technical assistance to school heads and teachers, pursuing this course will help me a lot in helping them to share the skills that I acquired. As their leader, I need to gain more knowledge and in able for me to provide assistance to them.</p>
    <p>I love reading, cooking and travelling. I am fond of reading the scriptures, magical and fantasy books. I used to cooked Filipino, Italian and Chinese foods. I wish I could travel the whole Philippines and some of the countries in Asia, Europe and I'm looking forward to visit Salt Lake Utah to attend General Conference of The cHurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.</p>
